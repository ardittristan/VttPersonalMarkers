# Personal Markers

This Module allows you to add markers to a scene only you can see.

## Installation

To install, import this [Manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardittristan/VttPersonalMarkers/master/module.json) into your module browser.

Make sure you've also have the [ColorSettings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardittristan/VTTColorSettings/master/module.json) library installed!

## Usage

If your mouse is hovering over the map and you press the middle mouse button (or key if you've bound one). The module adds a marker at that place. To remove a marker, you can just click again on the marker. These markers can only be seen by you, are scene bound and don't dissapear on reload.
